## Project Governance

- ALGOSUP is an innovative educational institution founded with a mission to revolutionize traditional university curriculums. The school was conceived through the vision of its co-founders, Éric Larchevêque (co-founder of Ledger) and Franck Jeannin (co-creator of the first UbiSoft games). Together with their colleague Natacha Boez, they sought to create an educational experience that bridges the gap between academia and the professional world.
