# Team Management & Quality Assurance Protocols
## Purpose

The purpose of this document is to describe the process of building the fresco which is approached in two steps:

<ul>
<li>Cube Configuration</li>
<li>Fresco Assembly</li>
</ul> 

Those steps will occur simultaneously spanning on three weeks, starting from Wednesday, October 11th and ending on the final delivery date: Thursday, October 26th.

## Introduction

Even though our Fresco is not the most complicated one, we believe that many things can go wrong in its construction. We must therefore apply strict quality assurance methods to ensure the project goes well, is finished on time, and that it will last over time.
 
However, we really like the idea that each group is motivated to come up with their own efficient manner of configuring the Rubik’s Cube. 

As we created the fresco that has been selected, we believe to be the most fit to manage its construction.

That is why we plan to have all the groups mass producing the Rubik’s cubes in their respective rooms, using their preferred method.

Each group will be given an 7th of the final Fresco (called slices) and each of those slices will be broken down into 11 equal parts (called chunks).

Each chunk has its corresponding cardboard grid on which the cubes are laid. It makes progress tracking easier, and verification easier.

One member of our group will be appointed as General Quality Officer and will visit all rooms during common successively, (in a loop) to verify the progress and collect finished chunks once to deliver them to the library for final assembly.

We only expect each group to elect a quality officer who will be accountable for the quality of their team’s work.

The rest is up to each group to decide.

There will be two types of team, each with their own functionning. The managing team, and the rest (solvers).

## Assembling Team Role Descriptions

There will be 3 members of our team who will be more or less  stationnary in the library. While the remaining three will be visiting the other rooms to monitor progress.

<ul>
<li>Fresco Assembler: Assembles the Fresco with the Chunks enqueued by the Checker</li>
<li>Chunk Checker: they check the quality of the chunks fetched by the courier and enqueue the Chunks for the Assembler to assemble on board</li>
<li>Courier: Delivers messages, restocks cubes, fetches finished and stashed chunks, and collects softlocked Rubik's cubes</li>
<li>Cube Master: Inspects the structural integrity of the fresco, resets soft locked cubes, helps on other tasks</li>
<li>Director of Operations: Director of operations (Makes decisions about strategy changes and observes and tracks processes as a whole, decides on scattering solvers and reattributing roles, as well as helping on other various tasks</li>
<li>General Quality Officer: Visits each room one by one to check on progress, stashed/finished chunks, inspects them and calls the courier to fetch them if necessary.</li>
</ul>

## Solving Team Role Descriptions

<ul>
<li>Quality Officer: As mentionned earlier, each group will have to elect a quality officer who will be accountable for </li>
<li>Rubik's Solver</li>
</ul>

## Set-Up

<ol>
<li>The entirety of the cubes will be checked on Wednesday, October 11th, or later if received later.</li>
<li>Cubes are transported to Project Room 3, which will serve as a depot</li>
<li>A 1:1 grid for the cubes' placement and trasport will be made using cardboard on Thursday, October 12th.</li>
<li>This Grid will be annoted with the coordinate system that will allow anyone to check what colors should be where</li>
<li>The Grid is cut in 7 Slices and each Slice in 11 Chunks</li>
<li><img src="images/finalGrid.jpg"></li>
<li>All the resulting carboard Chunks are placed in a stack in each room, with the top of the stack being the bottom part of the Slice (so that the end of the Assembly is near the top of it)</li>
<li>Each group elects their quality officer (if they struggle to do it, we have a spot the differences game that should allow to pick one that is at least observant</li>
<li>Once the election is done we will ask each solver to design a customized chip that we will print for them (which will be used to work with the cardboard grid)</li>
<li>Other members of the managing team will be here to double check that the correct chunks are in the correct rooms and in the correct order </li>
<li>In the meantime, the Library will be reordered to allow for more efficiency and storage of the chunks</li>
<li>A streaming camera is set up in the library, facing the Fresco and all project Room TV's display that stream in order for all teams to follow the progress of the fresco.</li>
<li>Each Team takes place with each member who needs to do checking with their devices with their checking/solving Algorithm of choice on their personal device</li>
<li>Each group is given 160 cubes by the Courier to start (a little more than 4 chunks)</li>

</ol>

## Role Attribution In Our (Management) Team

|Name|Role|
|---|---|
|Laurent BOUQUIN|Fresco Assembler|
|Laura-Lee HOLLANDE|Chunk Checker|
|Victor LEROY|Courier|
|Alexis LASSELIN|Cube Master|
|Clémentine CUREL|Director of Operations|
|Mathis Kakal|General Quality Officer|

## Role Attribution for the other (Solving) Teams

The other teams will decide who their Quality Officers will be, while the rest will be Cube Solvers.

## Additional notes & Risks

Since groups are never on project time simultaneously, each group will be independant and finished chunks will be stashed in the project room it has been completed until the management team comes to check it and collect it. The same applies for softlocked cubes, they will be stashed until our cube resetter is available to unlock them. 

Otherwise, if some teams are finished before others, they can help resetting the cubes, but must be ready to solve again if ever a mistake is found in their chunks

The streaming of the final assembly will allow teams to track their progress and will encourage them to find more efficient ways to solve the cubes as they see the different slices/groups being completed in real time.

Constant checking with the fresco and by visiting each rooms will allow us to react if ever a group is severely lagging behind. 

Depending on their lag, several strategies can be adopted. 

As we prepared our own software to solve Rubik’s cubes and check for quality we can provide those to the team if they are missing such tools.

We expect some teams are going to be more efficient than others, so if some teams are finished before others, they will be scattered to help the other teams by coaching them.

# Procedure

Lifecycle of a Cube

* The Quality Officer places the first Cardboard Chunk from the stack on the table for the solvers.
* The solvers place their chip on the carboard grid to indicate that they want to work on a certain cube (two chips cannot be placed on the same square).
* The solvers note the coordinates of the chosen square to display the pixel pattern and/or instructions for that pattern.
* They pick a clean Rubik's cube from their project room's stock and proceed to solve it using their personal/group's strategy (depending on what they decided).
* If they softlock it, they tell their quality officer about it, whom will stash it to the side for later recovery by a dedicated member of our team. 
* In that case they pick a new cube and start over.
* Otherwise, once they reached their objective, they double check the pixels correspondance to the software. And place the cube on the carboard chunk grid being aware that orientation of the Rubik's cube matters.
* They call the Quality Officer who double checks both pixel and cube placement on the grid and send the cube back for correction if cube is incorrect.
* Once the quality officer checks the last remaining cube on a chunk, they check the completed chunk one last time.
* After this check the chunk is stashed near the entrance of the room.
* When the time has come, the General Quality Officer will enter the room (at some point in his patrol) double check the stashed Chunk(s) and calls the courier to collect them if they are correct.
* The General Quality Officer is in a good position to film everyone's process as he travels from room to room, so he will be given a camera to document the different strategies and approaches that are undertaken by the students.
* The Courier comes and collects the Chunks and delivers them to the Chunk Checker in the library.
* The Courier also collects softlocked cubes if there are any and comes back to deliver cubes if group is almost out of those.
* The Chunk Checker double checks one last time the pixels and the cubes placement on the grid and proceeds to write the coordinates of the cube on the back of the cube to facilitate the Assembler's work.
* If there a problem is found, the Chunk is sent back to the group it came from or to another group that is more advanced, depending on the Director of Operation's decisions.
* The Chunk Checker enqueues the Chunk in the assembling queue, to respect the order of placement of each team as they arrived.
* At this point the Assembler only has to place the cubes chunk by chunk, in the order they arrived.
* The Cube Master and the Director of Operations both check the Fresco while the Cube Master also checks the integrity, robustness and alignment of each cube by testing them one by one with a testing protocol.
* At the end of their round the general quality officer stops at the Library to report on what is going on in the other rooms, as well as film the progress in the library, and then proceeds to visit the project rooms again.
* Once the whole Fresco is complete a final quality Check is made by the whole team.
* The library is rearranged.
* Rooms are rearranged.
* Cameras are placed.
* All the students come and gather around the fresco and Natacha and Frank and  JP are called to place the last two remaining cubes, while everything is filmed (by JP and our Team).
* Everybody cheers and The Fresco as the fresco is officialy inaugurated.
