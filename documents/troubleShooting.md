## What to do if the fresco slips or falls off

The fresco should not move, but if it does, here's how to proceed.

1. Remove the fresco or the part you want to fix it again

You will need a spatula and a source of heat to heat the glue in order to remove it using the spatula. In doing so, you should be careful not to damage the Rubik's cubes and store them by slice to avoid mixing up the patterns.

It is recommended to start from the top to avoid any accidents

2. Gluing

Before reassembling the chunks, you will need to clean the glue from the panels and the entire Rubik's cube to start with a clean slate.

Once that's done, you will need to use the [Ni clou ni vis](https://www.pattex.fr/fr/produits-pattex/ni-clou-ni-vis.html) glue to reattach each chunk to its original position.

We recommend having two people for this step and starting from the bottom to ensure the alignment of each part.

3. Allow drying and test

Let the glue dry completely according to the manufacturer's instructions. Avoid handling the Rubik's Cube during this period to allow the glue to properly harden.

Once the glue is dry, check if the fresco is securely attached to the pannel by gently manipulating it. Ensure it does not slide or easily detach.

If the mural is securely attached, your sliding problem should be resolved. If it continues to slide, you may need to reassess the gluing method or consider using a stronger adhesive.

Remember to take precautions when disassembling and gluing the Rubik's Cube to avoid damaging the fresco or the pannels. If you encounter any other issues, feel free to let we know so we can assist you further.

## Pannels that bend

If you notice that a panel is starting to come loose, you should first locate the center of the panel and remove the chunk that is there (refer to this document for instructions). Once that is done, you will only need to drill through the board and the wall to add a new screw before reattaching the chunk.
