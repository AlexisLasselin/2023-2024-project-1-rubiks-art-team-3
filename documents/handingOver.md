- Once the fresco has been selected the students are given approximately two weeks to organise their forces, solve the Rubik's cubes and assemble them in time, and taking quality and durability into consideration.
- We consider that the Fresco should preserve its total integrity for at least 3 years and more if not exponentially difficult to do so.
- To achieve this result, we have taken many factors into consideration, whether it is for the configuration of the cubes or for their final assembly on the wall.
- if we were to hand over the management of the construction, the first recommendation that would be given to a new team would be to read all of our Documents, including but not limited to:

	- Functional Specifications
	- Technical Specifications
	- Team Management & Quality Assurance
  
- Those documents are crucial to understanding of our methodology and should give plenty of insight on how we proceeded for the building of the fresco.
- As described in the Team Management & Quality Assurance document, our whole process is clearly defined step by step and depending on where our progress is at the time of the handover, several things need to be done.
- At the time of writing this document Oct 12th, 2023 , the entirety of the fresco has been produced by the cube solvers, however, only a portion of it has been checked.
- We therefore suggest that the team that might fulfil the management role in the future start by verifying the cubes for mistakes or defects.
- Using the numbers that are written on the boxes, which represent the coordinate of the area the cubes are contained in.
- There are three coordinate systems in our fresco:

	- The lowest level one is the cube grid, where each cube gets a coordinate following the a classic spreadsheet like system.

	- For practical reasons (transportability, division of the work, quality assurance, etc.) those cells are grouped into two other entities. First off, the whole grid is divided vertically into 7 "slices", for the 7 groups solving the cubes. Each of those slices are then divided into 11 "chunks" for the reasons mentioned earlier on (and because the grid is divisible by 11).

	- Finally, as we had to adapt (construction and solving started before we could even prepare all the material for the construction) we decided in an emergency to use cubes' original boxes to transport and stash the cubes. This gave birth to another coordinate system that is different, in a sense that it is made practical for building the fresco. The Y axis is inverted, meaning it starts from the bottom. Apart from the team 4, whom had a bigger slice than the others since the division wasn't perfect, each slice is considered to be exactly three consecutive cube boxes arranged in a horizontal manner.

	- All those box coordinates are written on top and inside of those boxes. They should be used to make double checking easier.

- For the construction of the fresco, no clear plan has been chosen as of Oct 12th, 2023 so we encourage the future managing team of discussing with us to get an idea of all the problems and questions we faced and tried to answer.
