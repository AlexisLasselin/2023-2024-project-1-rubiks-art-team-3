## Overview

## Cubes
- In order to realize our fresco, we have at our disposal 3000 Rubik's cubes of the 3x3x3 model. 
- These cubes are available in 6 colors: 
  - white <span style="color:#ffffff"> (#ffffff)</span>, 
  - red <span style="color:#f8001b"> (#f8001b)</span>, 
  - blue <span style="color:#0070dc"> (#0070dc)</span>, 
  - orange <span style="color:#ff6600"> (#ff6600)</span>, 
  - green <span style="color:#00e37a"> (#00e37a)</span>, 
  - yellow <span style="color:#dcd23c"> (#dcd23c)</span>.

- The dimensions of the cubes are 5.6cm x 5.6cm x 5.6cm, and their weight is 64g. 

## Tools

## Room configuration
<!-- plan 3D library -->
<!-- analyze of the wall -->
<!-- ALEXIS -->

The room is a rectangle of 8.3m of length and 3.8m of width. The wall is 2.5m of height.

According to the following pictures, the fresco will be placed against the white wall to be seen from the outside, or at least from the entrance of the building.

Unfortunately, we didn't have the idea of where put the bookshelves after the fresco installation.

### Problems

There is a problem with the wall. With a bubble level, we found that the wall was not perfectly straight. The wall is inclined of 1cm from the top to the bottom. This problem is minor, but it will be necessary to take it into account when placing the cubes.

Another problem is the presence of roughness on the wall. It's important to notice it when we will place the tape on the wall.

## Python Coding Conventions and Best Practices (PEP 8)


Our code will outlines the coding conventions and best practices for writing Python code, in accordance with the Python Enhancement Proposal 8 (PEP 8). Adhering to these guidelines ensures code consistency and readability, making it easier for developers to collaborate on the project.

### Code Layout

#### Indentation

- Use 4 spaces for indentation levels, not tabs.

```py
# Correct:

# Aligned with opening delimiter.
foo = long_function_name(var_one, var_two,
                         var_three, var_four)

# Add 4 spaces (an extra level of indentation) to distinguish arguments from the rest.
def long_function_name(
        var_one, var_two, var_three,
        var_four):
    print(var_one)

# Hanging indents should add a level.
foo = long_function_name(
    var_one, var_two,
    var_three, var_four)
```

```py
# Wrong:

# Arguments on first line forbidden when not using vertical alignment.
foo = long_function_name(var_one, var_two,
    var_three, var_four)

# Further indentation required as indentation is not distinguishable.
def long_function_name(
    var_one, var_two, var_three,
    var_four):
    print(var_one)
```

#### Maximum Line Length

- Limit lines to a maximum of 79 characters for code and comments.
- For long lines, break lines at a suitable point and continue on the next line with a 4-space indentation.

#### Imports

- Import standard library modules first, followed by third-party libraries, and finally your project's modules.
- Separate import groups with a blank line.
- Avoid wildcard imports (`from module import *`) as they can lead to namespace pollution.

### Whitespace

- Use blank lines to separate functions, classes, and blocks of code within functions.
- Surround operators with a single space on each side (e.g., `x = 10`, not `x=10`).
- Avoid extraneous whitespace at the end of lines.

### Naming Conventions

- Use `lowercase_with_underscores` for variable and function names.
- Use `CamelCase` for class names.
- Use `UPPERCASE` for constants.
- Prefix non-public attributes and methods with a single underscore (e.g., `_private_variable`).
- Avoid using single-character variable names, except for temporary variables (e.g., `i`, `j`, `x`, `y`).

### Comments

- Use descriptive variable and function names to minimize the need for comments.
- Write comments in clear, concise English.
- Use docstrings to document classes, functions, and modules.
- Keep comments up to date with the code they describe.

### Function and Method Signatures

- Use meaningful parameter names.
- Include type hints for function and method arguments and return values.
- Use default values for optional function arguments instead of mutable objects (e.g., lists or dictionaries).

### Coding Style

- Follow the [Zen of Python (PEP 20)](https://peps.python.org/pep-0020/) principles.
- Be consistent with your code style throughout the project.
- Use spaces around operators for clarity.
- Use parentheses to clarify the order of operations, even if they are not required.

By adhering to these Python coding conventions and best practices as outlined in PEP 8, we can ensure that our code is consistent, readable, and maintainable. This promotes efficient collaboration among developers and enhances the overall quality of our project.

ðŸ’¡ For detailed guidelines and additional recommendations, refer to the full PEP 8 document at [PEP 8, Style Guide for Python Code](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/).
