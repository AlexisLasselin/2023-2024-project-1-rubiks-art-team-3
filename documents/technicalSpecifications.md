## Overview

## Cubes

- In order to realize our fresco, we have at our disposal 3000 Rubik's cubes of the 3x3x3 model.
- These cubes are available in 6 colors:
  - white <span style="color:#ffffff"> (#ffffff)</span>,
  - red <span style="color:#f8001b"> (#f8001b)</span>,
  - blue <span style="color:#0070dc"> (#0070dc)</span>,
  - orange <span style="color:#ff6600"> (#ff6600)</span>,
  - green <span style="color:#00e37a"> (#00e37a)</span>,
  - yellow <span style="color:#dcd23c"> (#dcd23c)</span>.

- The dimensions of the cubes are 5.6cm x 5.6cm x 5.6cm, and their weight is 64g.

## Room configuration
<!-- plan 3D library -->
<!-- analyze of the wall -->
<!-- ALEXIS -->

The room is a rectangle of 8.3m of length and 3.8m of width. The wall is 2.5m of height.

According to the following pictures, the fresco will be placed against the white wall to be seen from the outside, or at least from the entrance of the building.

Unfortunately, we didn't have the idea of where put the bookshelves after the fresco installation.

### Problems

There is a problem with the wall. With a bubble level, we found that the wall was not perfectly straight. The wall is inclined of 1cm from the top to the bottom. This problem is minor, but it will be necessary to take it into account when placing the cubes.

Another problem is the presence of roughness on the wall. It's important to notice it when we will place the tape on the wall.

## Videos

### Timelaspe

To record the timelapse, we will use a GoPro 3 owned by one of our team member. 

The timelapse record will last for around 2 weeks. Starting when the final fresco will be selected, and will last until the fresco is finished.

We will be recording the different groups building the fresco, with their agreement, we could also record them doing the Rubik's cubes in their rooms, then follow them transporting the cubes to the library. 

The point of this timelapse will be to show to the other groups and keep memory of what we built, it will also be an interesting communication point for the school on social medias. 

The editing of the timelapse will be done with iMovie.


## Rubik's cubes configuration

To be able to create the fresco, we need to know exactly what every face on the fresco will look, that's why in the [Program](#program) section, we will explain how Laurent created a software that, with an image in entry, return the configuration of the Rubik's cube of your choice.



## Transport

The transfer between the project rooms and library will be done in 2 steps, the first one consisting on writing the coordinates of the place where the cube should be on the fresco with a pencil, in order to simplify the process if a cube is lost during the transport, it will be written on the opposite cube face of the one exposed in the fresco. The second step will be to take a cardboard to bring the cubes in the library.

## Set up

### The library setup

To prepare the library to the arrive of the Rubik's cubes, a grid will be drawn with pencil on the wall.

The squares on the grid will have a size of 5.6 x 5.6 cm each, which is the size of a Rubik's cube. On each square, the number of the case will be written to easily find the right place for the Rubik's cubes. 

The same grid should be drawn on the printed fresco to have a reference next to the wanted place.

### The fresco set up


## Removal

When the fresco will be removed or changed, it will probably left some tape on the wall. To remove the tape without any damage, the use of a hair dryer will be needed. 

- Heat the corners and edges of the adhesive to soften the glue,
- Peel it off using a card or a spatula from the edge,
- Heat again if it doesn't peel off,
- If there are some glue left on the wall, use a sponge soaked in saopy water.

## Python Coding Conventions and Best Practices (PEP 8)

Our code will outlines the coding conventions and best practices for writing Python code, in accordance with the Python Enhancement Proposal 8 (PEP 8). Adhering to these guidelines ensures code consistency and readability, making it easier for developers to collaborate on the project.

### Code Layout

#### Indentation

- Use 4 spaces for indentation levels, not tabs.

```py
# Correct:

# Aligned with opening delimiter.
foo = long_function_name(var_one, var_two,
                         var_three, var_four)

# Add 4 spaces (an extra level of indentation) to distinguish arguments from the rest.
def long_function_name(
        var_one, var_two, var_three,
        var_four):
    print(var_one)

# Hanging indents should add a level.
foo = long_function_name(
    var_one, var_two,
    var_three, var_four)
```

```py
# Wrong:

# Arguments on first line forbidden when not using vertical alignment.
foo = long_function_name(var_one, var_two,
    var_three, var_four)

# Further indentation required as indentation is not distinguishable.
def long_function_name(
    var_one, var_two, var_three,
    var_four):
    print(var_one)
```

#### Maximum Line Length

- Limit lines to a maximum of 79 characters for code and comments.
- For long lines, break lines at a suitable point and continue on the next line with a 4-space indentation.

#### Imports

- Import standard library modules first, followed by third-party libraries, and finally your project's modules.
- Separate import groups with a blank line.
- Avoid wildcard imports (`from module import *`) as they can lead to namespace pollution.

### Whitespace

- Use blank lines to separate functions, classes, and blocks of code within functions.
- Surround operators with a single space on each side (e.g., `x = 10`, not `x=10`).
- Avoid extraneous whitespace at the end of lines.

### Naming Conventions

- Use `lowercase_with_underscores` for variable and function names.
- Use `CamelCase` for class names.
- Use `UPPERCASE` for constants.
- Prefix non-public attributes and methods with a single underscore (e.g., `_private_variable`).
- Avoid using single-character variable names, except for temporary variables (e.g., `i`, `j`, `x`, `y`).

### Comments

- Use descriptive variable and function names to minimize the need for comments.
- Write comments in clear, concise English.
- Use docstrings to document classes, functions, and modules.
- Keep comments up to date with the code they describe.

### Function and Method Signatures

- Use meaningful parameter names.
- Include type hints for function and method arguments and return values.
- Use default values for optional function arguments instead of mutable objects (e.g., lists or dictionaries).

### Coding Style

- Follow the [Zen of Python (PEP 20)](https://peps.python.org/pep-0020/) principles.
- Be consistent with your code style throughout the project.
- Use spaces around operators for clarity.
- Use parentheses to clarify the order of operations, even if they are not required.

By adhering to these Python coding conventions and best practices as outlined in PEP 8, we can ensure that our code is consistent, readable, and maintainable. This promotes efficient collaboration among developers and enhances the overall quality of our project.

ðŸ’¡ For detailed guidelines and additional recommendations, refer to the full PEP 8 document at [PEP 8, Style Guide for Python Code](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/).

## Security

This solution has to not affect the security of other services, and systems.

The privacy of the users being very important, we decided to not save any kind of data.

## Trouble shooting
