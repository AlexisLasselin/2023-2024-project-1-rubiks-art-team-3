## Executive Summary

This project originated from a call for tender from ALGOSUP to its students on October 2nd, 2023 to design the fresco that will be displayed at the entrance of the B3, the complex in which the school is located. 

The fresco in itself can be compared to a mosaic since it is made of small square pixels, more precisely Rubik's Cube facets, which adds an interesting aspect to the building of the fresco: the configuration of the cubes into the patterns that will make up the final design. 

The Fresco should measure between 60-100 square feet. 

In terms of organisation and planning, the project has been divided into multiple phases by the customer (ALGOSUP). 

- Project Initiation
  - During this phase, eight team of 6 students (in average) will compete to produce the best suggestion artwork for a fresco, as well as a Functional Specifications Document, to increase their understanding of the project and develop on many aspects and challenges that would come later on.
- Project Planning
- Project Execution
- Project Closure

In terms of Risks and Issues, we

- Circle the Wagon on what risks/threats could emerge and how to mitigate them (including)
  - Expansion due to climate changing because of seasons
  - Damaging the stuctural integrity of the wall because of drilling through it
  - Not having enough cubes after cube damage

Circle the wagon on the assumptions & Constraints

## Project Definition

### Vision

Our vision is to deliver a Fresco, that will speak both to the residents of the B3 (Students, Start-Ups, Staff etc.), Vierzon citizens and people from the region in general.

We are aiming to make a fresco that will, like most frescos in history be a testimony of the City's past, present and future.

We want our fresco to tell a "story" rather than represent a view, an image or a literal message.

We like the idea that this Fresco is one of the first things seen entering this building, and consider it as an important vector to convey a message to any new student or resident of the B3, as a warm welcome to the B3's vibrant culture.

Therefore a lot of attention will be put into the designing and making the fresco, as it will be seen by investors and many different stakeholders and has the power to deliver subconscious messages to them.

### Objectives

<!-- => Review with group -->

Build a fresco at the entrance of the school

With 2000-3000 rubiks cubes

Must be done by Thursday, 26th October

Including all the students in the process

Document the process (both by documenting and recording)

Anticipate the next steps to gain more responsibilities

### Scope

| ✅ | Must be done     |
|---|------------------|
| ❌ | Must not be done |

<!-- ask for more in scope items -->
| In Scope | Must | Would | Should | Code |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| The build must be durable (3 years minimum without deterioration) | ✅ | | | |
| The Fresco's palette will be limited by the cubes' colors (no printing on the cubes) | ✅ | | | |
| Fresco must feature 50 cubes (number of students in the school) that will feature the name of a student behind (as an easter egg) | ✅ | | | |
| The fresco must be put in the library | | ✅️ | | |

<!-- ask for more out of scope items -->

| Out of Scope | Must | Would | Should | Could |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| The fresco must not block the wall power outlets. | ❌ | | | |
| The fresco must not pose safety concerns with regards to fire hazards (plastic) and room clearance (evacuation). | ❌ | | | |
| The fresco must not block access to technical areas. | ❌ | | | |
| The fresco must not require entire displacement of the library (bookshelves and seats/couches). | ❌ | | | |
| The fresco must not block the sunlight coming into the library | ❌ | | | |
| The fresco must not feature graphic, shocking or discriminative elements. | ❌ | | | |

To help the stakeholders know what resources are going to be required to fulfil the project:
| Assumptions |
|---|
| We assume we will get the rubiks cubes at least two weeks prior to building |
| We will get customer communication and/or approval for the different steps |
| We assume we will be able to store various items things in our rooms. |
| We assume we will be able to store things in library |
| We assume we will be able to reorder the rooms to work more efficiently |
| We assume we can use the tracer for testing dimensions and designs, and that it functions and ink is provided |
| We assume we can drill into the library's walls |
| We assume the B3's safety committee will allows the construction of the Fresco. |
| We assume that we will be able to engage the customers' finances to buy the required material for this project |

<!-- ask the team about constraints -->

| Constraints |
|---|
| We only have 5 weeks |
| No clear team organisation is defined |
| Building won't start before halfway of the project, because of selection phase. |
| We aren't too experienced in such medium scale building. |
| We only have 6 colors to our palette |
| We are not experienced in Rubik's cube solving |
<!-- | ? | -->

Project Exclusions:
Cube interchangeability for redesigning frescos every year.

### Dependencies

The four the phases mentioned above are successive and dependant on each other.
The only external factor that may impact (delay) execution and closure phases is printer Ink, Rubik's cubes, and plank delivery.

The Criticality of those dependencies is high, as the project cannot be delivered without them.

### Resource/Financial Plan

As students, we are paid in *experience points*
Apart from that, the project will require several expenses from the customer for various materials required in the construction of the Fresco, as follows:
The capital expenditures are listed in the budget plan (listed in the *project deliverables above*)
