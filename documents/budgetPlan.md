# Budget Plan

## Introduction

This document contains the estimate budget for the project. The budget is only taking in account the ressources needed for the installation of the fresco.

## Problem

Our previous solution to fix the cubes to the wall was to use cheap and basic double-sided tape. This solution has been disaproved by our client, mainly because depending of the weather (temperature, humidity, etc.) the tape could lose its adhesive properties and the cubes could fall.

## Solution

To replace the tape, we will use a more robust solution: MDF planks screwed to the wall. The cubes will be glued to the planks and taped between them. This solution will be more robust and will allow us to remove the cubes if needed without damaging the wall.

### Components and some technical details

- Cut MDF boards (10mm of thickness)
- 16 Molly bolts (CHEV MTL 6X50 VIS TCM6 5P)
- 16 screws (Included with the Molly bolts)
- Some industrial strength double-sided tape (TESA 4965 19mm x 50m)

Except for the double-sided tape, all the components' informations are taken from *Bricomarché* (price and references)

#### Why Industrial Double-Sided Tape?

After some discussion with a French Street Artist (Invader), we decided to use double-sided tape to fix the cubes to the MDF boards, the reason is that the industrial tape is made to support some extreme conditions (temperature, humidity, etc.) and is used by street artists to fix their mosaics to the walls, but it is also easy to remove if needed.

## Budget

### Components budget

| Component | Quantity | Total (CAD) |
| --------- | -------- | ----------- |
| MDF boards | 3 | 143€ personnalized cut included |
| Molly bolts | 16 | Near to 2€ if taken in bulk |
| Double-sided tape | 1 | 40,34€ delivery included |

The total budget for components is 185,34€.

### Human ressources budget

Currently, the human ressources budget is empty, because we don't know exactly how the client planned to make the installation of the fresco. We will update this section when we will have more information.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, our proposed budget plan outlines a dependable and practical solution for affixing the Rubik's Fresco to the wall. By replacing the previously suggested double-sided tape with MDF planks, Molly bolts, and industrial-strength double-sided tape, we address the client's concerns about adhesive reliability in various environmental conditions. This approach not only enhances the fresco's stability but also ensures the ability to remove the cubes without causing damage to the wall.

While we've provided an estimate for the components required, it's important to note that the total budget does not encompass the tools and installation costs, as the client intends to have the fresco professionally installed, and those fees remain undetermined. Nevertheless, our focus remains on delivering a solution that is resilient and adaptable to the client's needs.
