## Overview

This project is for ALGOSUP school. We need to make a Rubik's cube fresco for the building.
<!-- What? -->

## Project Scope
<!-- Why? -->

## Do Not
<!-- What not to do -->

- Break the cube to form the fresco, it must be assembled without damaging it;
- Paint the cube, it must be returned in its original state;
- Assemble the fresco with less than 2000 cubes and more than 3000 cubes;
- Use the fresco to denigrate a member of the staff or the school;
- Choose a too complex fresco, it would be a shame not to finish it;

## Fresco

## Thinking Process

Our main issue was the integration of the plugs with the fresco, we had to keep the access to them while exposing it. Our first idea was to keep the “natural” separation by putting Rubik’s cubes under and above it, but we realised that it was too much of a constraint for the design of the fresco. We then thought of adding a drawer system so all the cubes would be glued to each other, and removing the ones in front of the plugs would have given access to those electric outlets, but cancelled that idea because it made the access to the library to cleaning personal harder. Our next idea was to add a shelf right above the plugs so all the Rubik’s cubes could stand on it, but in terms of balance it wouldn’t have been the best solution. We finally thought of using double-sided adhesive in order to stick the cubes to the wall, we thought that it was the simplest and most efficient way to place the cubes.

### Set up

### Transportation

## Equipment

### Available

To carry out the project, these elements are available:
- **3000 Rubik's cubes 3x3**
  - Square,
  - 5,5 cm³ / 2.16535 inches³,
  - 64 grammes / 2.25753 onces,
  - Red, blue, green, orange, white and yellow
- **60 cm / 24 inches tracer**
- **Project room**
- **Library's wall**
  - 600 cm / 236.22 inches horizontally,
  - 220 cm / 86.6142 inches vertically

### Needed

To be able to build the freso, we will need:

- **Double-sided adhesive**

To be able to scotch all the Rubik's cubes to the library's wall, 18 meters / 59.0551 feet of double-sided adhesive foam tape will be needed. 

- 88 columns of Rubik's cubes.
- 34 rows of Rubik's cubes.
- 2.5 cm / 0.984252 inches for the length needed of tape for each cube.
- 88 * 34 * 2.5 = 7480
- 7480 cm / 2944.882 inches of tape are needed.
- 74.8 m / 245.4068 feet of double-sided foam tape are needed.
- This tape is about 0.59 cents for 4m / 13.1234 feet. 
- 74.8 / 4 = 18.7
- 18.7 tapes are needed for the middle of the cubes.
- 25 double-sided foam tapes are needed, because of the potential errors during the installation and to strengthen the counters of the Rubik's cubes. 
- 25 * 0.59 = 14.75
- The total for the tape needed is 14.75 euros.
- These tapes are available at Action. Av. du 19 Mars 1962, 18100 Vierzon.

- **Bubble level**

To be sure that the Rubik's cubes are well aligned, a bubble level would help us to be sure. People in the team already own a bubble level, so there is no need to buy one.
