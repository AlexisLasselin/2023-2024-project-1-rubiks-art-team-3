## Overview

This project is for ALGOSUP school. We need to make a Rubik's cube fresco for the building.
<!-- What? -->

## Project Scope
<!-- Why? -->

## Do Not
<!-- What not to do -->

- Break the cube to form the fresco, it must be assembled without damaging it;
- Paint the cube, it must be returned in its original state;
- Assemble the fresco with less than 2000 cubes and more than 3000 cubes;
- Use the fresco to denigrate a member of the staff or the school;
- Choose a too complex fresco, it would be a shame not to finish it;
