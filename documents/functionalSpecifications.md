## Overview

ALGOSUP[^8] invites proposals for the creation of a unique and visually stunning fresco. This 5-weeks project aims to transform a 60-100 square feet space into a permanent masterpiece made entirely of Rubik's cubes[^1]. Each cube will function as a 3x3 pixel matrix, with each facet representing a pixel in one of six colors: green, yellow, red, orange, blue, or white.
This fresco[^7] will become a permanent feature of ALGOSUP's school, it will be housed in the library and visible from the outside.

## Project Scope

8 teams will suggest an image and a functional for this call for tender, one of them will be choose. The choosen team will organise the raiminings weeks by managing the other teams in order to realise the fresco.
One of the aims of this project is to raise the visibility of the school, as well as its pedagogical aspects. It will provide an opportunity to learn about project management.
Following the school’s wish to share, a timelapse will be realised.

## What is not the project?

- Break the cube to form the fresco, it must be assembled without damaging it;
- Paint the cube, it must be returned to its original state;
- Assemble the fresco with less than 2000 cubes and more than 3000 cubes;
- Use the fresco to denigrate a member of the staff or the school;
- Choose a too complex fresco, it would be a shame not to finish it;

## Thinking Process

Our main issue was the integration of the plugs with the fresco, we had to keep the access to them while exposing it.

Our first idea was to keep the “natural” separation by putting Rubik’s cubes under and above it, but we realised that it was too much of a constraint for the design of the fresco.

We then thought of adding a drawer system so all the cubes would be glued to each other, and removing the ones in front of the plugs would have given access to those electric outlets, but cancelled that idea because it made the access to the library for the cleaning personnel harder.

Our next idea was to add a shelf right above the plugs so all the Rubik’s cubes could stand on it, but in terms of balance, it wouldn’t have been the best solution.

We finally thought of using double-sided adhesive in order to stick the cubes to the wall, we thought that it was the simplest and most efficient way to place the cubes.

## Tasks

### Fresco

<!-- Image + dimension -->
<!-- before after of the room -->
<!-- elements and why? -->
<!-- real and pixelized inspiration -->

### Division of the work

Once the fresco prototype is done, you will need to separate the fresco into eight fair parts. One part will be entrusted to each group, so configuring the Rubik's cubes will be easier and faster.

There is a total of 2992 Rubik's cubes, so each will have the responsibility of configuring 374 Rubik's cubes to match their part of the fresco.

*2992 / 8 = 374.*

Each team will be provided:

- The prototype of the fresco;
- The grid will have the colours and the number of the cube.
- A program that will let the user input the image of the fresco and select the id of the Rubik's cube (e.g: A1, B1, C1, etc.). The program will then return an image of the 3x3 Rubik's cube with the correct colours.

<!-- Image of the Fresco -->
<!-- Image of the grid -->

The grid will be organised as:

- Columns -> Numbers from 1 to 88
- Rows -> Letters from A to AH

|1  |2|3|...|4|5|
|---|-|-|---|-|-|
|A  | | |   | | |
|B  | | |   | | |
|...| | |   | | |
|AG | | |   | | |
|AH | | |   | | |


### Creation of the fresco

To fasten the creation of the fresco and to avoid random configurations, a program will be created to help the teams to configure the Rubik's cubes.

The program will have a graphical user interface (GUI) to make it easier to use.

On the GUI, the user will be able to select the the colours of the rubik's cube that he wants to configure. The program will then predict the moves that the user will need to do to configure the cube. The user will then be able to follow the instructions to configure the cube.

### Transfer

Before the transfer from the project's rooms of the library, each of the teams should have the number of the Rubik's cube corresponding to the grid written on it with a pencil. It will allow them to easily find the position of the cubes.

Once done, the teams will use a carton to transfer by putting the cubes on it in order to be easier to transfer in the fresco.

<!-- ecrire les numéros au crayon de papier ? -->
<!-- Croquis -->

### Set up

By the 26th of September 2023, all the Rubik's cubes need to be assembled in the library.

The first step of this task is to if it's possible, write with a pencil on the library's wall the grid with the numbers. This procedure would avoid the potential problems of putting a cube in the wrong place.

An image of the fresco should be displayed in the room during the installation as another level of security to avoid errors.

The double-sided foam tape will be used to fix the cubes to the wall. A piece of tape about 2.5cm / 0.984252 inches will be placed in order to touch 4 Rubik's cubes at the same time. Some foam tape will be added to the extremity to reinforce the fixation.

The pieces of tape will be added to the wall during the draw of the grid, so during the placement of the Rubik's cubes, only the protective tape will need to be removed. This procedure will also avoid errors in tape placement.

## Equipment

### Available

To carry out the project, these elements are available:

- **3000 Rubik's cubes 3x3**
  - Square;
  - 5,5 cm³ / 2.16535 inches³;
  - 64 grammes / 2.25753[^3] onces;

- **Library's wall**
  - 6m / 236.22 inches horizontally;
  - 2,2m / 86.6142 inches vertically.

### Needed

To be able to build the fresco, we will need:

- **Double-sided adhesive[^6]**

To be able to scotch all the Rubik's cubes to the library's wall, 18 meters / 59.0551 feet of double-sided adhesive foam tape will be needed.

- 88 columns of Rubik's cubes;
- 34 rows of Rubik's cubes;
- 2.5 cm / 0.984252 inches for the length needed of tape for each cube;
- 88 * 34 * 2.5 = 7480;
- 7480 cm / 2944.882 inches of tape are needed;
- 74.8 m / 245.4068 feet[^4] of double-sided foam tape are needed;
- This tape is about 0.59 cents for 4m / 13.1234 feet;
- 74.8 / 4 = 18.7;
- 18.7 tapes are needed for the middle of the cubes;
- 25 double-sided foam tapes are needed, because of the potential errors during the installation and to strengthen the counters of the Rubik's cubes;
- 25 * 0.59 = 14.75;
- The total for the tape needed is 14.75 euros;
- These tapes are available at Action. Av. du 19 Mars 1962, 18100 Vierzon.

- **Bubble level[^5]**

To be sure that the Rubik's cubes are well aligned, a bubble level would help us to be sure. People in the team already own a bubble level, so there is no need to buy one.

## Risks

- Damage on the wall -> clean with water and soap;
- A Rubik's cube fall from the fresco -> fixed the cubes on the four corners;
- A Rubik's cube in the wrong place -> Display the grid on the wall and a picture of he final fresco on the library.
